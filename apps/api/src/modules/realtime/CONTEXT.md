# Realtime

Realtime provides authenticated Socket.IO infrastructure, user rooms, and online/last-seen state. Conversation message, room-access, typing, and watermark behavior belongs to Conversations.

Socket authentication uses the API access-token boundary. A valid socket identity does not itself establish access to a conversation. Other contexts consume PresencePort instead of Socket.IO internals.

Presence is process-local. Enabling the Redis Socket.IO adapter distributes traffic but does not turn the in-memory registry into distributed presence. Consider that limitation before scaling API instances or changing online-based push suppression. Nest/Socket.IO owns namespace lifecycle; preserve proper shutdown behavior.
