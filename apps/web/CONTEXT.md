# Public web

The public site provides a localized landing page, legal pages, trust information, and the public account deletion page. At this branch's implementation, listing/dealer/blog routes and SSR marketplace data fetching are absent. Use the route tree to establish shipped pages; roadmap descriptions do not establish implementation.

`/healthz` is dependency-free and bypasses locale routing. The standalone production image uses Next.js output tracing at the monorepo root. Preserve deployment identity in health responses.

The account deletion page, `/[locale]/account/delete`, is Google Play's deletion link; the bare `/account/delete` redirects to a locale. The API has no CORS, so the browser never calls it directly: the form calls Server Functions, which call the public `account-deletion` endpoints through `src/lib/account-deletion.ts` with the shared contract schemas. Every message after a request must stay true whether or not a User holds the value, so the page reveals no more than the API. Server-side API calls use `API_BASE_URL`, then `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, the same order as admin. `API_BASE_URL` must be the private origin: through the public edge, the edge overwrites web's forwarded address and every visitor shares one budget. Web forwards the visitor's address to the API, and the API's per-IP Sign-in Code budget counts it. `src/lib/visitor-ip.ts` reads it with the API's rule (`CLIENT_IP_HEADER`, default the `X-Real-IP` that Railway's edge sets, and `CLIENT_IP_TRUSTED_HOPS`) and never falls back to a visitor-written `X-Forwarded-For`; with no usable value web forwards nothing and the API counts web's own address. Web sends it in `API_CLIENT_IP_HEADER`, default `X-Real-IP` ([ADR-0078](../../docs/adr/0078-the-api-trusts-one-configured-header-for-the-client-ip.md)). Any other ingress must set or overwrite the configured header, or visitors can choose their own budget.

Legal canonical links read runtime `WEB_BASE_URL`, matching mobile's `EXPO_PUBLIC_WEB_URL` for the deployment. Privacy and terms render on demand so promoting an image does not preserve the prior environment's canonical host. Set `WEB_BASE_URL` to the custom public web origin; when absent it falls back to `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`, then local development at port 3002.

Web shares browser components and theme tokens with `packages/ui`; mobile has separate native components. User-facing text must remain available in the supported locales.
