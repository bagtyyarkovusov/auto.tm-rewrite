 * This is a separate value, not `initialData` or `placeholderData` on the
 * detail query. A summary lacks the detail-only fields (contact, description,
 * seller), so writing it into the detail cache would let a half-filled Listing
 * pass for a loaded one, and the contact bar would trust it. Resolved once per
 * Listing: a deep link finds nothing and shows a plain skeleton.
