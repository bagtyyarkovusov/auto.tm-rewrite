# `infra/compose/`

Docker Compose files. Created during code scaffolding session.

## Planned files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docker-compose.dev.yml` | Local development — Postgres + Redis + MinIO + Mailpit (for testing) + app containers in watch mode |
| `docker-compose.prod.yml` | Production deployment to TM servers — full stack with healthchecks + restart policies |
| `docker-compose.observability.yml` | Prometheus + Grafana + Loki + Promtail + GlitchTip (lives on Server B) |
| `docker-compose.test.yml` | Spawns minimal Postgres + Redis for integration tests (used by Testcontainers fallback) |

## MinIO data contract

Local and TM-era Compose files mount MinIO's single data path at `/data`
(`minio-data:/data` in development, `/srv/auto-tm/minio:/data` in TM
production). Do not add a second object-data mount; backup/restore tooling
assumes the full object store lives under that one persistent path.

All three MinIO services use digest-pinned Chainguard images under
[ADR-0074](../../docs/adr/0074-digest-pinned-chainguard-minio-images.md).
Development and TM production use the minimal image. CI uses the dev image
because its health probe runs `wget` through a shell. The entrypoint remains
`/usr/bin/minio`, with `server /data` as its command. Mounted-volume services
explicitly run as `0:0` so fresh and previously root-owned data stays writable.
Preserve the volume and ownership when replacing the image.

Bucket creation and anonymous-read policy setup are explicit, not an API boot
side effect:

```sh
pnpm compose:up
pnpm minio:bootstrap
```

The same endpoint variables drive the backup/restore scripts:

```sh
pnpm minio:backup /tmp/autotm-minio-backup
pnpm minio:restore /tmp/autotm-minio-backup
```

## Service catalog (production)

```
Server A:
  - api          (apps/api)
  - admin        (apps/admin)
  - web          (apps/web)
  - worker       (apps/worker)
  - postgres     (primary)
  - redis
  - minio
  - caddy        (reverse proxy + TLS)

Server B:
  - sms-gateway  (apps/sms-gateway)
  - phone-agent  (×N — runs on physical phones, not in Docker)
  - postgres-replica
  - prometheus
  - grafana
  - loki
  - promtail
  - glitchtip
```

## Networking

- Server A internal: `auto-tm-internal` bridge network — only Caddy exposes ports externally
- Server A ↔ Server B: Telecom-local network (no public exposure)
- Caddy publishes: 80 (HTTP → HTTPS redirect), 443 (HTTPS for all subdomains)

## Conditional Listing image storage

The optional `conditional-v1` upload protocol requires an unversioned `listing-photos` bucket and working conditional PUT semantics. The API checks versioning and probes uniquely owned scratch keys before new authority or conditional generation; denied/unknown/versioned/unsupported storage fails closed. Never change live bucket configuration to satisfy a test. Hosted proof uses the CI digest from `docker-compose.ci.yml`; it does not establish support for the different dev/prod digest or the deployed media origin. Deployment versioning/permissions and actual native PUT proof remain operator-owned release evidence.

Shipped Listing PUT callers are native Expo and the Node smoke script. A future browser caller also needs deployed CORS permitting PUT and `if-match`/`content-type`; no CORS configuration is changed by this implementation. Legacy upload/generation remains compatible and supplies no conditional deletion guarantee. See [ADR-0088](../../docs/adr/0088-exclusive-upload-adoption-and-retirement.md).
