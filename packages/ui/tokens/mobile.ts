/**
 * Design tokens — mobile surface system (issue #695).
 *
 * The shared scales in this folder (`colors`, `radius`, `type`, `shadow`,
 * `motion`) stay the web and admin defaults. This module holds the values the
 * mobile app layers on top of them: surface levels, a rounder radius scale, a
 * type scale with named roles, elevation and motion springs.
 *
 * Consumed by `apps/mobile/tailwind.config.js` (utilities),
 * `apps/mobile/global.css` (the same surface values as CSS variables) and
 * `apps/mobile/lib/motion.ts` (springs and durations).
 *
 * Colours are HSL triplets ("h s% l%") so NativeWind can apply opacity
 * modifiers such as `bg-glass/90`.
