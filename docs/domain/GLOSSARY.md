# AutoTM Domain Glossary

This document is the canonical English engineering vocabulary for AutoTM. It defines what domain terms mean; it does not describe implementation status, future capability, user-facing translations, or delivery scope.

Charter decisions and accepted ADRs take precedence over this glossary. When a vocabulary decision changes materially, update the glossary through the ADR process defined by [ADR-0042](../adr/0042-domain-glossary-authority-and-mutability.md).
