# Domain and documentation guidance

## Working in a domain

Use the [glossary](../domain/GLOSSARY.md) for project meanings and avoided synonyms. In particular, a Verified Contact Phone is not a Sign-in Method. A term can exist before its feature ships.

Find the owning area in [CONTEXT-MAP.md](../../CONTEXT-MAP.md). Read that area's overview and follow its source/test links. Inspect callers and neighboring boundaries when the change crosses contexts. Use the issue and relevant PRD for expected behavior; do not infer capability from a table, glossary entry, or historical sprint label.

API contexts have framework-free `domain/` rules, `application/` use-cases, `infrastructure/` adapters, and `presentation/` transports. Keep Nest and Prisma out of domain code; map database rows at the infrastructure boundary. Cross-context calls go through injected ports or events rather than importing another context's internal domain/application code. Other modules import identity only through `identity/identity.public.ts` (plus `identity.module.ts` for Nest composition); `apps/api` lint enforces this. Keep one use-case per file with one job, and verify business rules with domain/application tests.

## Document authority

[ADR-0060](../adr/0060-source-first-agent-context-and-task-scoped-guidance.md) supersedes ADR-0019's exhaustive implementation mirrors and amends the CONTEXT.md role in ADR-0020/0042. Historical ADRs retain their original text; consult the [ADR index](../adr/README.md) for supersession.

| Question | Read or update |
|---|---|
| What does a term mean? | [Glossary](../domain/GLOSSARY.md), governed by [ADR-0042](../adr/0042-domain-glossary-authority-and-mutability.md) |
| What is implemented? | Source, schema, tests, and runtime evidence |
| Where should I look and what boundary matters? | Map and owning CONTEXT.md |
| What should a capability do? | Owning PRD feature or flow |
| What must this task deliver? | Issue acceptance criteria and linked specification |
| Why was this chosen? | Relevant ADR or charter decision |
| What is scheduled? | Roadmap and relevant sprint plan |
| What did this attempt finish? | The PR's Execution state |

For new PRDs, material capability revisions, or sprint changes, follow [ADR-0020](../adr/0020-document-hierarchy-and-mutability.md). Merged ADRs are immutable; write a superseding ADR. Started sprint plans stay locked and retros are append-only. Semantic vocabulary changes and ownership changes follow ADR-0042; routine definitions go into the glossary. User-facing copy belongs to approved designs and i18n resources.

## Writing local overviews

Keep only material that helps someone choose the right code or avoid a non-obvious mistake:

- What this area owns and where its responsibility ends.
- Current constraints or important limitations, with links to evidence.
- The few source, test, specification, or decision entry points needed to investigate it.

Headings are optional; do not create empty sections. Do not inventory every field, method, route, event payload, dependency version, or file. Do not copy resolved bugs, task progress, tutorials, or future specifications into an overview.

Update an overview in the same PR when its documented ownership, boundary, constraint, or important limitation changes. Routine internal changes do not independently require prose updates. Update the map when context ownership or locations change. Keep source links accurate; documentation cannot replace inspecting implementation.

Generic domain-modeling skills sometimes call their glossary CONTEXT.md. In AutoTM, route those writes to `docs/domain/GLOSSARY.md`; our local CONTEXT.md files are orientation notes. Do not introduce a second glossary or copy global skills into the repo.
