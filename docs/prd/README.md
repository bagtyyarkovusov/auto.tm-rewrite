# Product Requirements — AutoTM

This directory is the **product spec**. ADRs answer *why*; CONTEXT.md describes *what is true now*; the PRD describes *what we're building*.

Read in order if you're new:

1. [00-vision.md](00-vision.md) — what AutoTM is and why
2. [01-glossary.md](01-glossary.md) — domain language
3. [02-phases.md](02-phases.md) — scope per phase
4. [03-roadmap.md](03-roadmap.md) — **the trajectory** (current sprint + sprint status table + milestones)
5. [10-personas.md](10-personas.md) — who uses it
6. [20-information-architecture.md](20-information-architecture.md) — sitemap + nav

## Sprints

Per-sprint detail (DoD, file list, tests, references) lives in [`sprints/`](sprints/):

| # | Sprint | Phase | Milestone |
|---|---|---|---|
| [01](sprints/sprint-01-scaffold.md) | Scaffold | 1 | M1 |
| [02](sprints/sprint-02-identity.md) | Identity (OTP) | 1 | M2 |
| [03](sprints/sprint-03-catalog.md) | Catalog | 1 | — |
| [04](sprints/sprint-04-listings-crud.md) | Listings CRUD | 1 | M3 |
| [05](sprints/sprint-05-search-listing-detail.md) | Search + listing detail | 1 | M4 |
| [06](sprints/sprint-06-contact-seller.md) | Contact seller | 1 | M5 |
| [07](sprints/sprint-07-minimal-admin.md) | Minimal admin + moderation | 1 | M6 |
| [08](sprints/sprint-08-private-beta-polish.md) | Private beta polish | 1 | M7 |

Post-MLP sprint files get created from shaped bets after the Phase 1 beta retro (see [03-roadmap.md](03-roadmap.md) and [ADR-0027](../adr/0027-mlp-beta-scope.md)).

Deferred features should not become orphan sprint files or loose issues. Put the target capability in the owning feature PRD or flow, add/keep a row in `03-roadmap.md` with a trigger to build, and create a sprint file only when the bet is shaped for execution. `CONTEXT.md` may mention the item only as a planned addition that points back to that PRD/sprint home.

Then pick a feature:

## How to write a PRD page

Every page follows this skeleton:

```markdown
# <Feature>

## Summary
<one sentence — what this is>

## Why it exists
<user problem in 1-2 paragraphs>

## What it does (user-visible behavior)
<numbered list — screens described not just named>

## Screens / states
<each screen: purpose, primary action, edge cases, error states>

## Data references
<points to relevant CONTEXT.md files>

## Decisions
<points to relevant ADR numbers>

## Phase
<Phase 1 / 2 / 3 — explicit>

## Out of scope (explicit anti-list)
<things we considered but chose not to build>

## Open questions
<things still TBD — should be empty by code-freeze>
```

Keep pages 1-3 pages each. Smaller = under-specified. Bigger = nobody reads them.

## Closing a phase or beta gate

At a phase boundary, run a documentation closeout before creating the next wave of sprint issues:

1. Reconcile roadmap status against shipped sprint retros and closed parent/child issues.
2. Check every post-MLP candidate has a PRD/flow home and trigger to build.
3. Remove or relabel orphan issues that imply Phase 1 work but are really Phase 2/3 bets.
4. Confirm `CONTEXT-MAP.md` indexes every current `CONTEXT.md`.
5. Confirm changed invariants landed with matching `CONTEXT.md` updates.
6. Add an ADR only for material capability movement or a surprising architectural trade-off; routine deferred-feature placement does not need one.
