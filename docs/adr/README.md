# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains architecture decisions for AutoTM. ADRs are **immutable after merge** — they document what was decided, when, and why.

## Effective documentation policy

[ADR-0060](0060-source-first-agent-context-and-task-scoped-guidance.md) replaces ADR-0019's exhaustive implementation mirrors with source-first, task-scoped orientation. ADR-0042 still owns vocabulary; ADR-0020 still governs all other document roles and historical mutability. Older records below remain unchanged.

## Per-app ADRs

| Location | Scope |
|---|---|
| `apps/api/docs/adr/` | API-specific (DTO patterns, error envelopes, controller conventions) |
| `apps/admin/docs/adr/` | Admin UI specific (component library choices, layout) |
| `apps/web/docs/adr/` | Public web specific (SSR strategy, OG generation) |
| `apps/mobile/docs/adr/` | Mobile specific (navigation, state mgmt, deep linking) |

## Format

Every ADR follows this skeleton:

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN: <Title>

- **Status**: Accepted | Superseded by ADR-XXXX | Rejected
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Deciders**: <names>

## Context
<the situation that forced a decision — constraints, alternatives in scope>

## Decision
<what was chosen, stated as a present-tense declarative sentence>

## Consequences
### Positive
- ...

### Negative / accepted costs
- ...

### Neutral
- ...

## Alternatives considered
- **<Option B>** — <why rejected>
- **<Option C>** — <why rejected>

## References
- Charter §X
- Related ADR-NNNN
```

## Rules

1. **Numbered sequentially.** Don't reuse numbers.
2. **Dated on creation.** Update the date on a superseded note, never the original.
3. **Immutable after merge.** To change a decision, write a new ADR that supersedes the old one and updates this index.
4. **One decision per ADR.** Don't bundle five decisions into one document.
5. **Concrete, not aspirational.** "We will use NestJS" — not "we should consider NestJS."
