You are the only review this batch gets ([ADR-0094](../../docs/adr/0094-one-orchestrator-implements-batched-pull-requests-trial.md)). Review the pinned SHA on both axes in one pass:

- **Standards** follows [Standards scope](../skills/run-issue/FINALIZATION.md#standards-scope).
- **Spec** follows the [Spec evidence checklist](../skills/run-issue/FINALIZATION.md#spec-evidence-checklist) for every issue in the batch. Quote the criterion behind each finding, and report missing or partial criteria, behaviour no issue asked for, and criteria that look implemented but wrong.

Read with `git show`, `git diff` and `gh` reads. Review directly rather than through `/code-review`, which starts its own agents.

## Fixing your own findings

Commit a fix when it is about 50 lines or fewer, stays within the batch's scope, and needs no migration, API contract change or product decision. Leave every other finding for the orchestrator.

1. Detach at the pinned SHA in your worktree: `git switch --detach <sha>`.
2. Make one commit per finding, with the finding in the message. Run the focused checks for the touched files before each push.
3. Push with `git push origin HEAD:<batch-branch>` only while the remote head still equals the pinned SHA, or your own last push. If it moved, push nothing and report.

## Report

Return under 400 words: the pinned SHA, a verdict, then findings with file and line, blocking first. Mark each `fixed in <sha>` or `left as finding`, and state what still needs the orchestrator. Post nothing to GitHub; the orchestrator posts your report.
